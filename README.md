# SimpleSentimentAnalysis
I built a simple program that performs sentiment analysis using a twitter API.

To get the program to run, first create an API on Twitter's developer website, then put the correct tokens & keys in their correct place on the program. Finally make sure you specify what you want the program to search.

# Dependencies
pip install tweepy
pip install textblob
